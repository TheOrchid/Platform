# Documentation
----------

ORCHID is a tool (Platform) that allows you to quickly write simple but powerful websites and applications.
Provided as a package for Laravel, you can easily integrate it as a third-party component using Composer

### How to read the documentation

If you are a beginner, I recommend that you read the documentation "Laravel" from start to finish.
The ORCHID documentation does not explain the capabilities of the framework.
If you are already familiar with Laravel, you can go directly to the appropriate section.

This documentation begins with an explanation of the concept and architecture of ORCHID, before delving into specific topics.


### Introduction

Most business applications are of the "form over data" type and provide a user interface for viewing, adding and modifying data
When you use other development tools to create applications such as "forms over data", a significant amount of time is spent performing repetitive tasks.
You write code for interaction with the database, code for the user interface and code for business logic.
Â 
Using ORCHID saves you from many repetitive tasks, you only need to write one type of code - business logic.


### Features for Business Applications

Modern business applications require many features, such as search capabilities, the ability to sort and reorder the nets, as well as the ability to export data.
All these and many other features are already built into ORCHID applications. In addition, typical data operations, such as adding, updating, saving and deleting, are also built in as a basic data validation logic.

Using custom controls and applying shell extensions to change the layout. You can use custom field types to reduce the amount of code created and simplify the formatting in the user interface.



### Conclusion

ORCHID takes care of all the routine operations to develop business applications, giving users the ability to focus on a unique business logic that meets their requirements.

Despite the seeming simplicity, it allows you to solve many tasks with the help of standard settings, and, if necessary, expand your own functions.
