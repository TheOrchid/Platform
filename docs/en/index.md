## Introduction

ORCHID - is an instrument for [RAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) development of websites and linear business applications. 
It is shipped as a package for Laravel and can be easily integrated using Composer, it harmonizes well with other PHP components. 
You may also register additional third-party components for Laravel or ones found on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/).

## How to read the documentation

If you are a newcomer I recommend you to read the Laravel documentation from start to end, at [laravel.com](https://laravel.com).
ORCHID does not explain the framework capabilities. If you are already familiar with it you may proceed directly to reading further sections.

This documentation begins with an explanation of concept and architecture of ORCHID before it dives into particular themes.

## Capabilities 

ORCHID takes upon itself the routine business application development operations by adding custom control elements, fields, templates and screens, and allowing to concentrate on the application's unique business-logic.

Despite its simple appearance it allows you to solve many problems using standard tools while also allowing to add your own custom functionality if required.


Following the [tutorial](/en/docs/installation/) you can quickly install and use it.
