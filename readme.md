###### Some features:

- **Easy To Get Started** - We are developing in PHP. It is not necessary to use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Everything to make applications easy to use. Check it out with a [quick start](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart/).

- **Form builder** - There is no need to describe forms of the same type in html. There are [many custom fields](https://orchid.software/en/docs/field/) prepared that are easy to use.

- **Fast Loading Pages** - A performance like a single page application. Transitions without reloading the page, not writing a single line of code. Thanks to the [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) project, this has become excellent and simple.

- **Security Permissions** - Can be used to enable or disable whole screens, or user interface behaviors, based on a user‚Äôs identity and corresponding role membership. Find out more in the [documentation](https://orchid.software/en/docs/access/).

- **Filtering & Sorting** - There is no need to describe forms of the same type in html. There are many custom fields prepared that are easy to use.

- **Data Search** - Find the information you need from any page. Integrated Laravel Scout takes care of the search results.

- **User Notifications** - One-time and personal notifications will be a great way to notify users about what is happening in your application.
