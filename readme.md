### Interesting Features

- **Quick Start** - Focus to PHP development and don't loose time with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Build application logic not admin panels. Try our [quick start guide](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart/) for your own "jump start".

- **Form Builder** - Prevent reinventing the wheel and writing HTML to create forms. There are already [40+ form elements](https://orchid.software/en/docs/field/) available "out of the box" for you, to be used.

- **Fast Loading Times** - Enjoy a performance like a single page application (SPA). Transitions can be made without reloading the page and not even writing a single line of code. Thanks to the [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) project, Orchid makes this an satisfying experience for you and your users.

- **Access Permissions & Roles** - Take advantage of granular access permissions, based on a user‚Äôs identity and corresponding role membership. Read more about this topic in Orchid's [documentation](https://orchid.software/en/docs/access/).

- **Filtering & Sorting** - Offer your users the possibility to filter and sort data according to their own needs. Use our [quick start guide for Eloquent based filtering/sorting](https://orchid.software/en/docs/quickstart-sort-filter-table/) to learn more about this topic.

- **Fulltext-Search** - Take advantage of the integrated Laravel Scout, which allows searching all available pages, and displays search results almost instantly. Learn [here](https://orchid.software/en/docs/global-search/) about Orchid's Scout integration.

- **Mutiple Types of Notifcations** - Do you need notifications? Orchid offers even various types of notifications and allows you to keep your users constantly informed. Our [documentation](https://orchid.software/en/docs/alert/) offers more information about this topic.
